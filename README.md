## Description
In the app, a writer is required to register before creating a Blog Post. After registration, the writers can create blogs as per the categories that are in the app. Users do not need to sign up before using the app. They can read blog posts and comment on the posts without registering on the app. Once the users comment on any blog post, the writer who wrote the post can delete the comments made by the users if they find them inappropriate. Additionally, writers can also delete the blog posts that they do not wish to remain in the app.
